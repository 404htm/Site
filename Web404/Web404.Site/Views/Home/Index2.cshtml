			I was planning to put together something really informative and useful for my first post - that isn't happening apparently so here are some shiny function plots.
			I was bored earlier this week and decided to draw some random functions in linqpad.

		<p>
			The code is dead simple, each pixel's color values are generated by a function of the x and y coordinates.
			Some of the plots ended up being far more interesting than I expected so I wanted to share some of the images and code, as well as a generator so you can play and make your own.

			I'll try for useful next week<sup>*</sup>
