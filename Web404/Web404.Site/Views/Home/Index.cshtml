		<p>Hi!</p>
		<p>My name is Kelly, I'm a web developer living in upstate NY. I love code and I'm putting together this site as a place to document projects, workarounds, rants, and snippets from whatever I happen to be working on. I work primarily in C#, ASP.Net MVC, SQL, and JavaScript but I  frequently try to branch out and learn new languages and libraries. I'm obsessed with metaprogramming techniques at the moment, and I am also developing a strong interest in data-visualization and machine learning.</p>
		<P>I've been attempting to put together this site together for a few years now. Usually I get distracted before I can put together a post – so this should be the first version that isn't just filled with Lorem Ipsum text and regret. I spend way too much time programming at home – I'm hoping this will motivate me to finish up some of the things I've been working on – rather than just finishing the most interesting parts and moving on to whatever else happens to catch my eye. </P>
		<p>Thanks For Reading, Hope you find this site to be useful. </p>
		<p>Happy Coding!</p>

		I was planning to put together something really informative and useful for my first post - that isn't happening apparently so here are some shiny function plots. 
		I was bored earlier this week and decided to draw some random functions in linqpad.
		</p>
		<p>
		The code is dead simple, each pixel's color values are generated by a function of the x and y coordinates.
		Some of the plots ended up being far more interesting than I expected so I wanted to share some of the images and code, as well as a generator so you can play and make your own.

		I'll try for useful next week<sup>*</sup>
